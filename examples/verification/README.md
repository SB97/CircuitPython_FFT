The files used here are to be run with python3 and demonstrait the verification of the fft written in 
circuit python to the numpy version. There is more error but this is to be expected for a small device
and the computational precision needed for the fft and its reverse.

using the same code to generate samples on each device shows a much greater discrepancy in error if we use 
the samples generated out of the circuit python the error is greatly reduced.
